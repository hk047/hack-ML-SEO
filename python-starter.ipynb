    "\n",
    "### Hi There, Future Innovators! 👋  \n",
    "We’re thrilled you’re here! Today, you’re stepping into the exciting world of **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning (ML)**—two areas that are changing how we live, work, and play. Don’t worry if coding feels new or scary; we’ll guide you every step of the way, and you’ll be amazed at what you can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s AI All About?  \n",
    "AI is like giving computers a brain to think and make decisions. You’ve already seen it in action:  \n",
    "- **Netflix** magically knows which shows you’ll love based on what you’ve watched.  \n",
    "- **Siri or Alexa** listens to you and answers your questions like a friend.  \n",
    "- **TikTok** picks videos that keep you scrolling for hours.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools use AI to learn from data—like how you learn from practice. In this notebook, you’ll use news articles to teach a computer to sort them into topics (like \"Tech\" or \"Health\") or figure out if they’re positive or negative. That’s AI in action, and you’re about to make it happen!\n",
    "\n",
    "### You’re About to Build Your Own AI Tool! 🚀  \n",
    "By the end of this, you’ll create a simple AI model that can classify text. Think of it like training a robot librarian to sort books into the right categories. Ready to get started? Let’s go!\n",

    "## 2. Getting Started in Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Google Colab?  \n",
    "**Google Colab** is a free, online tool where you can write and run Python code without installing anything. It’s like a magic notebook that lives in your browser—perfect for beginners like you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use It  \n",
    "1. **Open Colab**: Visit [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and click “New Notebook.”  \n",
    "2. **Cells**: Your notebook has two kinds of cells:  \n",
    "   - **Code cells**: Where you type Python code to make things happen.  \n",
    "   - **Text cells**: Where you write notes or explanations (like this one!).  \n",
    "3. **Run a Cell**: Click the little play button (▶️) next to a code cell to run it. The result shows up below.  \n",
    "4. **Save It**: Go to “File” > “Save a copy in Drive” to keep your work safe in Google Drive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick example—run this cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: You just told the computer to say hi! The `print()` command shows whatever’s inside the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Basics for Notes  \n",
    "Markdown is a fun way to make your text look awesome in text cells. Try these:  \n",
    "- `# Big Title` for a giant heading  \n",
    "- `## Smaller Title` for sections  \n",
    "- `- Item` for bullet points  \n",
    "- `**Bold**` to make words pop  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Challenge**: Add a text cell below this one. Write “My First Notebook” as a heading and your name in bold. Run it to see how it looks!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Python Basics (with Examples and Challenges)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a super-friendly programming language, and we’ll learn it step-by-step with examples you can relate to. Let’s start!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Data Types  \n",
    "Variables are like labeled jars where you store stuff—like your name or favorite number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment—it’s just for us humans; the computer ignores it!\n",
    "name = \"Maya\"      # A string (text)\n",
    "age = 15           # An integer (whole number)\n",
    "loves_music = True # A boolean (True or False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the values\n",
    "print(\"My name is\", name)\n",
    "print(\"I’m\", age, \"years old\")\n",
    "print(\"Do I love music?\", loves_music)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `name = \"Maya\"`: Puts the text \"Maya\" in a jar labeled `name`.  \n",
    "- `age = 15`: Stores the number 15 in a jar labeled `age`.  \n",
    "- `loves_music = True`: Stores True (yes!) in a jar labeled `loves_music`.  \n",
    "- `print()`: Opens the jars and shows what’s inside.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "My name is Maya\n",
    "I’m 15 years old\n",
    "Do I love music? True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy**: Imagine putting your name on a nametag—that’s a variable!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini-Challenge 1** 🌈  \n",
    "In a new code cell, make variables for:  \n",
    "- Your name  \n",
    "- Your age  \n",
    "- Whether you like video games (True or False)  \n",
    "Then print them out. Stuck? Copy the example and change the values!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists  \n",
    "Lists are like a playlist of your favorite songs—ordered and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hobbies = [\"gaming\", \"reading\", \"drawing\"]\n",
    "print(hobbies[0])  # First item\n",
    "print(hobbies[2])  # Third item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `hobbies = [\"gaming\", \"reading\", \"drawing\"]`: Creates a list with 3 items.  \n",
    "- `hobbies[0]`: Grabs the first item (0 is the starting point).  \n",
    "- `hobbies[2]`: Grabs the third item.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "gaming\n",
    "drawing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Think of a list as a numbered locker row—`[0]` is the first locker!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops  \n",
    "Loops repeat stuff for you, like playing every song in your playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for hobby in hobbies:\n",
    "    print(\"I like\", hobby)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `for hobby in hobbies`: Takes each item in `hobbies` one by one and calls it `hobby`.  \n",
    "- `print(\"I like\", hobby)`: Prints a message with that item.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "I like gaming\n",
    "I like reading\n",
    "I like drawing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: It’s like a DJ spinning each track in order!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionals  \n",
    "Conditionals are like decision points—if this, then that.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 50:\n",
    "    print(\"You passed!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Try again!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `score = 85`: Stores 85 in `score`.  \n",
    "- `if score >= 50`: Checks if `score` is 50 or higher.  \n",
    "- `print(\"You passed!\")`: Runs if true.  \n",
    "- `else`: If the check fails, this part runs instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "You passed!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: It’s like a teacher checking your test score—pass or study more?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions  \n",
    "Functions are like mini-recipes you can reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hi(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hi there,\", name)\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hi(\"Leo\")  # Use the function!\n",
    "say_hi(\"Zara\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `def say_hi(name)`: Names the function and says it needs a `name`.  \n",
    "- `print(\"Hi there,\", name)`: The recipe—prints a greeting with the name.  \n",
    "- `say_hi(\"Leo\")`: Runs the recipe with \"Leo\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Hi there, Leo\n",
    "Hi there, Zara\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: It’s a vending machine—put in a name, get a greeting!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini-Challenge 2** 🌟  \n",
    "Write a function called `check_age` that takes an age and prints \"Teen\" if it’s between 13 and 19, or \"Not a teen\" otherwise. Test it with your age!  \n",
    "**Hint**: Use `if age >= 13 and age <= 19`.\n",

    "## 4. Working with CSV Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s play with real data! We’ll use **Pandas**, a tool that’s like a super-smart librarian for organizing info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s a CSV?  \n",
    "A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is like a table in a notebook. Our dataset has news articles with these columns:  \n",
    "- **Title**: The headline  \n",
    "- **Description**: A short blurb  \n",
    "- **Topic**: The category (e.g., \"Tech\")  \n",
    "- **Subtopic**: A specific tag (e.g., \"AI\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the Data  \n",
    "First, let’s bring the CSV into Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd          # Get the Pandas library\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(\"news_articles.csv\")  # Load the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `import pandas as pd`: Unlocks Pandas tools (we call it `pd` for short).  \n",
    "- `data = pd.read_csv(\"news_articles.csv\")`: Opens the file and stores it in `data`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For this to work, you’d need a file called \"news_articles.csv\" uploaded to Colab. Ask your teacher for it, or use a sample link if provided!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peek at the Data with `.head()`  \n",
    "Let’s see the first few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(data.head())  # Show the first 5 rows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `data.head()`: Grabs the top 5 rows of `data`.  \n",
    "- `print()`: Displays them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "                   Title            Description  Topic Subtopic  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `data.info()`: Lists all columns, their types (text, numbers), and if anything’s missing.  \n",
    "- `print()`: Shows it to us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output**:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n",
    "RangeIndex: 100 entries, 0 to 99\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since our data is mostly text, it shows how many unique entries (like different titles) and the most common ones. It’s like counting how many times \"pizza\" appears on a lunch menu!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Intro to Machine Learning (with Analogies)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Machine Learning?  \n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is teaching a computer to learn from examples, like how you learn to ride a bike by practicing. Imagine teaching a dog to fetch: you throw the ball a bunch of times, and it figures out what to do. In ML, we give the computer data (like news articles) and let it find patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "- **Supervised Learning**: You’re the teacher. You show the computer examples with answers—like \"This headline is Tech\" or \"This is Health\"—and it learns to guess for new ones.  \n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**: No teacher! The computer looks at the data and groups similar things together, like sorting your socks by color without being told how.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Supervised is like studying with a tutor; unsupervised is like exploring a new game on your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification and Sentiment Analysis  \n",
    "- **Classification**: Putting things in buckets. Example: Is this email spam or not? For us, it’s sorting news into \"Tech\" or \"Health.\"  \n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Guessing the vibe of text. Is a review happy 😊 or grumpy 😣? Useful for understanding opinions!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are They Useful?  \n",
    "Classification helps organize the world (think spam filters), and sentiment analysis helps understand feelings (like how brands check if people love their products).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools We’ll Use  \n",
    "- **Scikit-learn**: Simple ML models—like a starter kit!  \n",
    "- **TextBlob**: Easy sentiment checker.  \n",
    "- **Transformers**: Super-powerful AI from HuggingFace—free and awesome!  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Installing Libraries in Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these cool tools, we need to install them in Colab. Run this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib textblob transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line-by-Line Breakdown**:  \n",
    "- `!pip install`: Tells Colab to grab these tools from the internet.  \n",
    "- `pandas scikit-learn matplotlib textblob transformers`: The list of tools we want (data handling, ML, plotting, sentiment, and advanced AI).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: It’s like downloading apps on your phone—once installed, they’re ready to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "### HuggingFace Setup (Optional Fun!)  \n",
    "HuggingFace has amazing free AI models. Here’s how to unlock them:  \n",
    "1. Go to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) and sign up.  \n",
    "2. Click your profile > “Settings” > “Access Tokens” > “New Token.”  \n",
    "3. Copy the token and use it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "# If a token is needed (not always!):\n",
    "# from huggingface_hub import login\n",
    "# login(\"paste_your_token_here\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: For basic stuff, you won’t need a token, but it’s here if you want to level up later!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Build Your First Text Classifier (Basic Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make an AI that guesses the `Topic` of news articles from their `Title`! We’ll use Scikit-learn and keep it simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Split the Data  \n",
    "We need training data (to teach) and testing data (to check).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "X = data[\"Title\"]  # Input: the headlines\n",
    "y = data[\"Topic\"]  # Output: the topics\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Does**:  \n",
    "Splits our data: 80% to train, 20% to test—like practicing with most of your flashcards and saving some to quiz yourself later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Necessary**:  \n",
    "Training on everything and testing on the same data is cheating! Splitting keeps it fair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What Might Go Wrong**:  \n",
    "If `data` isn’t loaded, you’ll get an error—check Step 4!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment**:  \n",
    "Change `test_size=0.2` to `0.3` (30% test)—does it change anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Turn Text into Numbers  \n",
    "Computers love numbers, not words. We’ll use `CountVectorizer` to count words.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n",
    "X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Does**:  \n",
    "Turns titles into a number grid—like counting how many times \"AI\" or \"Health\" appears.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Necessary**:  \n",
    "The model needs numbers to learn patterns, not raw text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What Might Go Wrong**:  \n",
    "If your titles are empty, it’ll fail—make sure your CSV has data!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment**:  \n",
    "Print `vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()` to see the words it learned!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Train the Model  \n",
    "We’ll use `LogisticRegression`, a simple but smart model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "model = LogisticRegression()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Does**:  \n",
    "Teaches the model to connect word counts to topics—like learning which words signal \"Tech.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Necessary**:  \n",
    "Training is how the AI learns—without it, it’s just guessing!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What Might Go Wrong**:  \n",
    "If the data’s messy (e.g., missing topics), it might struggle—double-check `.info()`!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment**:  \n",
    "Try `max_iter=500` in `LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)` if it warns about iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Predict  \n",
    "Let’s see what it guesses!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictions = model.predict(X_test_vec)\n",
    "print(predictions[:5])  # First 5 guesses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Does**:  \n",
    "Uses the trained model to predict topics for the test titles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Necessary**:  \n",
